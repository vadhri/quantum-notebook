Photon polarization is similar to quantum bits. Superposition and entaglement are properties of quantum bits. 

Polarization
- Horizontal ( angle 0 )
- Vertical ( angle 90 )

Classical bits 0 or 1 
Vertical polarization - Qubit 1 
Horizontal polarization - Qubit 0 

Polarization filters 
Vertical photon direction - Vertical polarizing filter - Pass through 
Vertical photon direction - Horizontal polarizing filter - Opaque 
Vertical photon direction - Filter at theta - partial pass through.

|QML-Project.*|A presentation giving details of the appoach and various aspects|
|all_classes_classification_classical|Two jupyter notebook(s) demonstrating CNN in classical way for multiclass classification using tensorflow and pytorch|
|binary_classification_classical| A jupyter notebook demonstrating CNN in classical way for binary classication in tensorflow |
|binary-classification-hybrid| A jupyter notebook demonstrating binary classification with hybrid approach with a quantum layer using bellman circuit using pytorch|
|multi-classiciation| Multiple jupyter notebook(s) demonstrating multi class classication using hybid for bellman circuit and real amplitdes circuit|

Data hanlder classes are similar across all the projects and are inside the respective jupyter notebooks handing the required classes for loading, splitting data.
